[Music]

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,640
hello and welcome to the first live

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,000
lecture of the course

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
so before we jump into things there's

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,200
just a couple logistics to

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,360
uh handle here the first one is that we

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,040
have a new website so if you check the

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,320
link in the description

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
there's a new official course website uh

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,560
and again this is something that anybody

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,279
in the world is

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960
free to attend the lectures for if you

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,119
want to second we're going to be doing

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:25,920
the discussion

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
during this lecture through discord so

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,920
if you want to answer questions or ask

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,519
questions or interact with the other

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,640
professors

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,200
while i give this lecture the discord's

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,320
the place to do it

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,239
um questions will be fed to me and we

22
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,760
can pull them up on screen here

23
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,000
so for example it looks like last time

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,360
there were some people asking about some

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,719
of the functions i was using in the

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,520
notebook

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
uh which i failed to mention were custom

28
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,879
defined within that notebook

29
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,559
so if you just try and like open raw

30
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,920
julia to call destinate

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
it doesn't mean anything but it was just

32
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,199
this small little custom thing

33
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
and in general we'll share the notebooks

34
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,399
that we're using so if you want to

35
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,840
follow along you can see all those

36
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,120
pre-definitions

37
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,039
um and with that you know we only have

38
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,479
30 minutes for this lecture

39
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,240
convolutions are super interesting and

40
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
let you do a bunch of powerful things

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
so i say let us just jump right into

42
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
things

43
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
so as a first example i'm just going to

44
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
take this 8-bit mario

45
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,520
that we see this very low resolution

46
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
image and i want to blur it

47
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
and if you're thinking about blurring an

48
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
image maybe the first thing that you

49
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,520
could think to do

50
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,759
would be to look at each pixel and kind

51
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,759
of average it with all of its neighbors

52
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,920
and do this sort of moving average so

53
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,200
the way i'm doing it here we've got this

54
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,920
little grid

55
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
uh three by three grid of values that's

56
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,079
marching across the image

57
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
and slowly creating a new image on the

58
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,079
right and to be concrete what's going

59
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,600
on here is each of those values is 1 9

60
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
and we're sort of thinking of lining

61
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
them up with some pixels multiplying

62
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,079
each of those values by the

63
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,439
corresponding pixel

64
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,439
and then adding them together so in this

65
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
case if they're all 1 9 then we multiply

66
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
them and we add them together

67
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,159
we're just taking an average of the nine

68
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159
pixels so in this

69
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
specific window it looks like there's

70
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,439
four black pixels

71
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,960
four gray pixels and then one that's

72
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,040
kind of the mario skin tone color

73
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,479
so you would expect the average to be

74
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
like a darker gray with the tiniest

75
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
you know hint of mario skin color and if

76
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
we go and look at the new

77
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
image that's being generated and what's

78
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,319
painted into that pixel

79
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,760
it's that it's a dark gray with the

80
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,400
tiniest hint of some kind of skin color

81
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
and as we keep marching along we get

82
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
this blurrier image of mario we might

83
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
zoom in on another example

84
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
um here you know this grid it's mostly

85
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,879
covering the skin color with just a

86
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,760
little bit of black

87
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
here and there so we would expect it to

88
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,239
be a dyed down version of that

89
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,560
which is what we see um and he's this

90
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
gives kind of a nice effect right

91
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
we zoom out and we see uh what was once

92
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,080
this nice clean

93
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
8-bit mario same resolution uh nothing's

94
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,879
changed about the resolution but what

95
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,360
we've got is kind of this blurrier image

96
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,599
now a couple nuances about what's going

97
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,640
on here because

98
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
uh as with so many things in computer

99
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
science there's edge cases to handle

100
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,480
in this case it's a literal edge case

101
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
like what's going on at the edge

102
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,239
because if we just let this grid of

103
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,239
values fall off the side

104
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,800
and you know maybe we either don't count

105
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,879
them or we're multiplying them by zero

106
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
what ends up happening is we would only

107
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
be taking four ninths

108
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
of the given corner value and it's going

109
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
to end up disproportionately dark

110
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,959
which in some mathematical contexts

111
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159
maybe that's what you want you would

112
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,360
want to treat the image as being

113
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,319
something where

114
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
outside of a certain domain it's

115
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,519
entirely zero

116
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
but when our eyes look at the blurred

117
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,560
image it doesn't quite seem right

118
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,080
because you see all of this black

119
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,680
or this sort of darker gray along the

120
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
side and what we

121
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
expect is that this was an image taken

122
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,879
in a broader context where what's

123
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,000
surrounding

124
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,319
you know mario's world is the same gray

125
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,760
that we would have thought

126
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,799
so in the problem set for today's uh not

127
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
today's lecture for this week's uh

128
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,440
uh lectures you've got well you've got

129
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
the task of basically

130
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,080
defining a function that will handle

131
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
this and a more general variety of

132
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,959
what's going on here

133
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,239
and one thing to think about is what

134
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
happens at that edge and

135
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
a typical convention in image processing

136
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,239
context would be that

137
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,599
when you're falling off the edge like

138
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,319
that you uh you just

139
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
uh multiply by the nearest value right

140
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,760
so if you see that it's

141
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,000
1 9 times 0 instead of falling off the

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,799
edge you take the

143
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,720
the nearest value in the image and that

144
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,239
would make the boundary of our

145
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,799
mario look a lot more gray so that's all

146
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,160
well and good

147
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,519
but there's another nuance that we might

148
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,520
want to handle here which is

149
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
you know if we're not in a super low

150
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
resolution context like this but if

151
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,360
we're in

152
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,720
something that's higher resolution and

153
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
we want to have a box that's a little

154
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,600
bit bigger

155
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
like maybe i have this 5x5 box that's

156
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
wandering along

157
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
it's a little bit strange to treat all

158
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
of the pixels in that 5x5 box with equal

159
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,080
weight

160
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,520
because the ones towards the center are

161
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
somehow more representative of what's

162
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
going on in that image

163
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
at that point than the ones that are

164
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,759
farther around

165
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,120
so for this example what i've actually

166
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
done if we zoom in here um

167
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
is i've given a grid of values that

168
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
aren't all the same you know it's not

169
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
all 1 divided by 25 in this case

170
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
but the middle one is 0.162 and out at

171
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,080
the

172
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,600
farther regions we've got 0.003

173
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
so when we multiply those by the

174
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
corresponding pixel values and then we

175
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,000
add them all together

176
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,919
we're basically taking a weighted sum

177
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,600
weighted according to how close to the

178
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
center it is

179
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
and that's a that's a way of saying that

180
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
okay it's okay for this pixel here to be

181
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,240
influenced by what's at the outer corner

182
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
but only by a little bit you know we

183
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,960
shouldn't we shouldn't get into it too

184
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,160
much

185
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,320
these specific values are coming from a

186
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
gaussian curve also known as a bell

187
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,720
curve

188
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
so you might imagine kind of this bell

189
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
curve surface sitting on top of the

190
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,720
image

191
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
and it's bulging right above the point

192
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,840
that we want and then it dissipates in

193
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,320
values

194
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,639
as you go away from that and that gets

195
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
us a much nicer notion of

196
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
uh averaging the pixels so that it's

197
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,639
like i said it's taking into account how

198
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,320
close they are to the point we want

199
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
the gaussian specifically has some

200
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
really nice mathematical properties that

201
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
we might talk about

202
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,639
a little later on in this lecture that

203
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,479
makes it really really quite nice for

204
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,880
doing this kind of operation

205
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
now this operation that we're doing as

206
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
you can infer from the title of the

207
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,120
video and

208
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
uh everything about this and what we

209
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
talked about last time

210
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,560
it's a convolution what you would say is

211
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
that the image on the right

212
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
the resulting values that we get are a

213
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,479
convolution of

214
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,360
the original image with the little grid

215
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,039
of values that we have here

216
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,960
okay so it's an operation that takes in

217
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
at least in an image processing context

218
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
two different grids of values maybe one

219
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
is rgb maybe one is numbers

220
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,479
they could both be numbers and it

221
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
combines them to get a new grid of

222
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,720
values

223
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
in other mathematical contexts we often

224
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
think of it as combining two functions

225
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
to get a new function

226
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,080
and when you're doing it with uh just

227
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,319
this little smaller window

228
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,919
it's quite common to refer to it as a

229
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,319
kernel so in this case we would say that

230
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
we convolved mario with a

231
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,919
gaussian kernel okay and at this point

232
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,160
you might sit back and think okay you

233
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,360
know that's all well and good i guess

234
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,759
with

235
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,520
different kinds of averages i could get

236
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,039
different sorts of blurring effects

237
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,639
going on in the images and

238
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,080
you know i guess there's some use cases

239
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,599
for blurring images like blurring out

240
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,880
faces

241
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,560
but it goes way beyond that actually

242
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,479
first of all smoothing out an image with

243
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,919
a gaussian kernel

244
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,759
is useful in a lot of contexts beyond

245
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
what you would expect

246
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,400
but the important thing i want you to

247
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
keep in mind here is not the specific

248
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,199
example

249
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
but um the general framework that's

250
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,240
being developed

251
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
where if we tweak what the values inside

252
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
that kernel are

253
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
we can start to do some more nuanced and

254
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
interesting things with images

255
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,280
and to get to that you know i say let's

256
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,440
just dive right into actually coding up

257
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
some examples here

258
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
so um i'm just going to be creating a

259
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
little pluto notebook like i did last

260
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
time here

261
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
and uh right now i've prepared it with

262
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,120
an image so i've created a large image

263
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
is loading a certain image of tom the

264
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,400
cat

265
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
and then i've shrunk it down mostly just

266
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
so that it's easier to see on the screen

267
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
but also that makes some of the things

268
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
faster to play with so if we just check

269
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,479
the size of the image

270
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,160
it's now a very small 500 by 399

271
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
and again by the way if any of you want

272
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
to ask questions

273
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,039
and you do so in the discord some of

274
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,560
them will be like forwarded in my

275
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
direction and i'll try to keep my eye on

276
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,120
if any of those have come in so feel

277
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
free to just do that whenever

278
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,479
and um oh i'm told my mic is peaking a

279
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,039
little bit

280
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360
so let me let me just turn that down a

281
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,879
little bit give you a better

282
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,960
uh sound experience hopefully it's not

283
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
too unpleasant in any ways

284
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,240
it's always so finicky to get these live

285
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
streams to work properly

286
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
but we want to actually do this uh

287
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
convolving operation right we want to

288
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,639
actually see what happens when we mess

289
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
around with different kernels

290
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
so first of all to get a given kernel

291
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,479
there's this library that i'm going to

292
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,599
use

293
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,959
we've got all of our definitions down

294
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,240
here for various functions i'm going to

295
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,800
have

296
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,080
but i'm going to be using one called

297
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
image filtering and in

298
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,279
it it has this module called kernel

299
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,800
and we can pull up the documentation for

300
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
it you know just using the live docs

301
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,040
here

302
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
where it tells us the various different

303
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
functions it has in there and among them

304
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
is this gaussian which is exactly what

305
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
you want but it already tells you that

306
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,120
there's more interesting kernels that

307
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
can be played with

308
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,839
and if i create a gaussian and i specify

309
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
two different standard deviations one in

310
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
the x direction one in the y direction

311
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
what it gives me is a grid of values so

312
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
we take a look and this type is a five

313
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,880
by five

314
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,160
offset array okay so essentially it's an

315
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,120
array of floats

316
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
but the offset just means that um the

317
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,040
way that you index into it

318
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
let's give it a name like kernel

319
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
is such that the middle value is at zero

320
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
zero so if i called kernel of zero

321
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,959
zero i get that middle value that we

322
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,560
actually saw in the animation point one

323
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
six two

324
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
um and then if we take you know

325
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,720
something like negative two which

326
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,200
usually

327
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
you know you can't index at zero much

328
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,720
less below zero

329
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,279
uh with julia arrays in this context

330
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
it's specifically offset

331
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
that doesn't matter too much just wanted

332
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
to say in case you were wondering what

333
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,200
that term means

334
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
what we actually want is a nice way to

335
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
take a look at what this kernel is

336
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
so i wrote a very simple function just

337
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,399
called show colored kernel

338
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
that's basically pulling out the

339
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,080
positive part and making it green

340
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
and then if a kernel has negative part

341
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
it's going to pull it out as red

342
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
so you can take a look at the details if

343
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
you want for that later

344
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,279
but all i want is for you to think about

345
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,760
okay

346
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
we've got this little grid of values

347
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
that's very peaked at one point and then

348
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,079
kind of dissipates out

349
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,519
we're gonna have it march along the

350
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,279
image of the cat here

351
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
and what's that gonna do and you already

352
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,560
know what it's going to do because we've

353
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,839
played around with mario

354
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
but the idea is that as we tweak what

355
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,040
this kernel is we'll get some more

356
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
interesting things

357
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,160
so what you will write in the problem

358
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
set this week is a function called

359
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,120
convolve

360
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
it will do exactly this it'll take in an

361
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
image it'll take in this kernel of

362
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,360
values

363
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
and it'll produce a new image which in

364
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,880
this context

365
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
is a little bit blurrier now because

366
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,079
this is a small kernel

367
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,680
you know maybe it's not as visible but

368
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,519
if i changed it to be a gaussian

369
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
with standard deviation 3 the library is

370
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,120
smart and it knows to make it

371
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
a little bit bigger if i want it to so

372
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
now it's a 13 by 13

373
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
array and we see that it indeed does

374
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,399
make it notably blurrier

375
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,760
and we could go to an extreme we could

376
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,959
say you know i want the standard

377
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,079
deviation to be

378
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,360
quite a bit larger so maybe 10 by 10

379
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,279
and this gets me a much larger array so

380
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,880
that little gaussian

381
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
curve that we're imagining marching

382
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,720
along the image that would now be 41 by

383
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
41

384
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
and the result that you get is that

385
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
every pixel is really influenced by a

386
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,160
lot around it

387
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
very much like you took a lens and you

388
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,560
um you unfocused the image

389
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
now while we're here and because this is

390
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,959
a class about computational thinking

391
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,079
let's think a little bit about

392
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
computational complexity because

393
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,880
in order to process that image there

394
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
julia's generally pretty fast

395
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,839
um but this took 9.5 seconds now a big

396
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,200
part of that is maybe because i wrote

397
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,320
this convolved function

398
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
less efficiently than it could be we'll

399
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
talk later this lecture about

400
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
like very clever things that are done to

401
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
make it more efficient

402
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
but just in principle if you want to

403
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
like actively think about how many

404
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,640
operations are taking place here

405
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
uh it's a fun little exercise to think

406
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
about because the size of our image

407
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,079
right it looks like it's not too big

408
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
it's 500 by 399. which means if we take

409
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
the product of those two values let's

410
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,120
give that's

411
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
the number of pixels um so if we

412
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,800
multiply that by

413
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,880
the number of values in the kernel so

414
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,079
the product

415
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,240
for the size array on the kernel

416
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
it's actually quite a few different

417
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
multiplications that have to happen

418
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,480
through this whole process because

419
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,959
remember

420
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,320
every time that little window is sitting

421
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
on top of a pixel you're multiplying all

422
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,839
of those neighboring values and then

423
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,880
you're adding them up

424
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,320
so in this context it looks like we've

425
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
got you know thousand million

426
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
just for one simple small image like 300

427
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
million multiplications have to happen

428
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,920
so that's just a thing to think about

429
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,480
here is that as the kernel gets larger

430
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
it unless you do something clever it

431
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,279
will by default take a lot longer to

432
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,720
process images especially if they're

433
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,399
higher resolution

434
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
but before we talk about how to

435
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,680
diminish that kind of complexity let's

436
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
just play around with what happens if i

437
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
change this kernel

438
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
so actually before i even show you i

439
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
think i want to do this as a live quiz

440
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,560
so that might be a little bit fun where

441
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
um we were doing a couple of these in

442
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,360
the intro animation just

443
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
some warm-up questions but as the first

444
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
real question

445
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,519
uh i'm going to give you a sample kernel

446
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,800
okay i'm not going to show you what it

447
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
does or tell you what it does

448
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
but i want you to actually try to think

449
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,040
about what this would do

450
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
okay so it's going to be a little 3x3

451
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,160
grid and

452
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,920
it's got a lot of negative values around

453
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,160
the boundary and the center value is a

454
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,959
7.

455
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,240
okay so it's going to be seven at the

456
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,079
center and then some negative values

457
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:22,720
around it

458
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,399
specifically one for the immediately

459
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,160
adjacent neighbors and then

460
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
negative point five for all of those

461
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
around it

462
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,120
and uh at this point if you go to

463
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,519
itempool.com3b1b

464
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,519
live you can place a vote we're seeing

465
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
the statistics on how other people are

466
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,160
answering

467
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
and i'm i'm actually genuinely curious

468
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,519
what people will

469
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,320
uh will say to this one so this is going

470
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
to be our first example of a

471
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
non-blurring

472
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
well maybe i shouldn't say that maybe

473
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
it's obvious from the context the

474
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
blurring isn't going to be the right

475
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,680
answer

476
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
but while you while you answer that i'm

477
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
going to go ahead and type that up

478
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,839
into our notebook just to have prepared

479
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,199
and also while you answer it think about

480
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:07,600
what

481
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
aspects of this kernel you could try to

482
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
compute

483
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,880
to get a loose sense of how it would

484
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
behave in different uh regions of the

485
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,279
image

486
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,639
you know if it's in a monochromatic

487
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,320
region what does it look like if it's in

488
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
a region where there's a lot going on

489
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
what does it look like like try to try

490
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
to think through some examples in your

491
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,279
head

492
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,279
and that's probably around the amount of

493
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,360
time i want to spend

494
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
although let's let's just take a look if

495
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
there's any questions in the doc

496
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,519
to uh to answer while we're waiting

497
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,240
there

498
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,839
is it possible to reconstruct the

499
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
original image from the blurred one

500
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,800
i i don't think so um

501
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,839
that's an interesting question we'll

502
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,040
have to ask the other professor i

503
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,320
definitely don't think so because you

504
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
can take this to an extreme

505
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,600
where uh it feels like you're definitely

506
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,160
losing out on information

507
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,440
there's other things that you can do to

508
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
it though like the fast fourier

509
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,320
transform would be an example where you

510
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,839
can recover the image exactly

511
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
but those feel like you know very rare i

512
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,600
don't want to say that offhandedly

513
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,079
because

514
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,279
i don't know quite off the top of my

515
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,120
head one of the other props who's

516
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,760
smarter than i

517
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,320
might come in to answer um and the

518
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
second one

519
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
uh how does convolving an image with a

520
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
kernel directly relate to convolving two

521
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,600
functions

522
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,519
glad that you asked that um i'll talk

523
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
about that in just a little bit actually

524
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,920
what the

525
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
relationship between image processing

526
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
definition of convolution is and then

527
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
how you see it in some other

528
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
mathematical contexts

529
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
it's essentially the same idea though

530
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
that you have one thing that's marching

531
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,920
across another

532
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
you multiply corresponding values and

533
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,959
then you add them up

534
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,040
it's it's really the same operation

535
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,680
modulo like one or two small conventions

536
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,279
all right so if we go back to our quiz

537
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
i'll go ahead and

538
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,440
see what the answers turn out to be here

539
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
and

540
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,959
fascinating so it looks like most people

541
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,440
thought that it would detect edges

542
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,880
but if we actually play with this if we

543
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
go to our notebook here

544
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
and i've gone ahead and written in the

545
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,880
kernel so

546
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,480
that same grid of values that i gave you

547
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
where seven in the center and then some

548
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,519
negatives around

549
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,360
the effect that it has on the picture of

550
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
the cat here is it actually

551
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
kind of sharpens it up so if we look

552
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,040
previously his chest is very fluffy very

553
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,839
soft

554
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,279
but over here what it's done is really

555
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,519
accentuated the differences between one

556
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,079
piece of fur in the next

557
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,920
now for those of you who did answer edge

558
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,680
detecting you're definitely on the right

559
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,320
track

560
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,160
uh but one small thing that you could do

561
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
to kind of check what the behavior of

562
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,120
this kernel might be

563
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
is to notice uh what the sum of all of

564
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
those values are

565
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,199
the spelling kernel here so if we add

566
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,720
them all up they equal one

567
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
which is much the same that you would do

568
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
with any kind of um

569
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,279
weighted average if you have all the

570
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
weights they've got to be one

571
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,880
and what that means is that if you're in

572
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
a region of the image without any edges

573
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
okay you're in like a totally

574
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,800
monochromatic spot if you add up all of

575
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
the values and you're multiplying them

576
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,279
and the sum for the kernel is one well

577
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,560
that means that you're just going to get

578
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,000
the original color back

579
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,680
the circumstances under which this does

580
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
something non-obvious

581
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,199
are when there's a lot of variation near

582
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,120
a point so if you have one point that's

583
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,640
um let's say a very bright pixel

584
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,000
and then it's surrounded by very dark

585
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
pixels that will end up looking quite

586
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
bright because the dark ones aren't

587
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
subtracting off in the way that other

588
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
things are

589
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
now if you want to think about edge

590
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,799
detection stuff there's a couple

591
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
standard kernels that we might play with

592
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
for that so one of the simplest

593
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,760
would be what's called a sobel kernel

594
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,600
and in this context it's yelling at us

595
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,440
because what it returns isn't actually a

596
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,200
single kernel but a pair of them

597
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,080
so i might pull out just one or maybe

598
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
the second index

599
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,559
um and let's let's go ahead and

600
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,400
visualize this kernel see

601
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,520
first of all we've got that the sum is

602
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,799
zero so that's telling us something

603
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,600
interesting

604
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,320
let me do my show colored kernel

605
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
great so we see it's got positive values

606
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,760
on the right

607
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,919
and it's got negative values on the left

608
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,120
but crucially

609
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,880
now if we add up all of those values it

610
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
comes up to zero so if you would imagine

611
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
taking this kernel and you put it over a

612
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
monochromatic part of the image

613
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
it's going to come out completely black

614
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
which sort of matches with what we see

615
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,400
here where

616
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
at first it looks like it's completely

617
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
turning the image black but

618
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,799
let's think a little bit more about what

619
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,799
we would expect this specific kernel to

620
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,520
do

621
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,039
so if we've got our image in mind of

622
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,200
taking you know a specific

623
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
little grid of values and what are we

624
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,559
doing we're just kind of marching it

625
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
across the image

626
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
what would you expect to be required for

627
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
this to end up as a positive number well

628
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,679
if we're adding up some positive values

629
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,559
on the right

630
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,320
and then we're subtracting off whatever

631
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
they multiply on the left

632
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,520
then if you have some region where it

633
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880
goes from being very dark

634
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,280
to being very bright that's going to be

635
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
where you get positive values

636
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,799
but notice you can also get negative

637
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,320
values here if you had a lot of

638
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,679
brightness on the left

639
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,679
and then a lot of darkness on the right

640
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
what this convolution would give you

641
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
is a negative value so that's important

642
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,320
to keep in mind

643
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,520
just because we're displaying these

644
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,679
convolutions as rgb images

645
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,360
doesn't mean that's always the right way

646
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,120
to see it because in this context when

647
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
we've convolved

648
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
our fluffy cat with something that

649
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,760
occasionally puts out negative values

650
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,360
the way that the rgb type is going to

651
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
treat that is

652
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,559
not necessarily going to be displayed in

653
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,919
a way that shows everything that's going

654
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,559
on

655
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,480
so what i could do instead is take an

656
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,559
absolute value of everything happening

657
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,679
not an absolute value of the convolution

658
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,400
so we've got our convolution take an

659
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
absolute value

660
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
of what's sitting there and that's

661
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
basically if i take the absolute value

662
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,120
of an rgb

663
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,799
it's um treating it like a vector

664
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,720
getting the norm this gives us a grid of

665
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,360
values

666
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
i still want to see it as if it was

667
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,280
colors so i'm going to tell pluto hey

668
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
i want you to think of these as

669
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
grayscale values

670
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
and i might even scale them up a little

671
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
bit just because i'm especially not sure

672
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
how the youtube compression is handling

673
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,000
this all

674
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
but this will really just accentuate out

675
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
all of the points where

676
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,919
this sobolfilter convolved across the

677
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,840
image ends up non-zero

678
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
and what you see is all of the points

679
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
where there's a lot of micro variations

680
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,320
as you move uh from left to right kind

681
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,159
of like the uh

682
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
you know the different color fur that

683
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,440
happens on the chest

684
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
that's where you start to get a lot of

685
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
activity

686
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,559
and if we take the other thing that this

687
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,159
kernel.sobel returned

688
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
it basically gives us the horizontal

689
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,000
version of that okay so as you move

690
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
up and down for example right around the

691
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,360
whiskers that's going to be where you

692
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
get a lot of this variation

693
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
and that's what's going to make the

694
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
convolution of the image with this

695
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,280
specific

696
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
kernel something non-zero so the point

697
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,440
here is that you know you can do

698
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
blurring you can do sharpening you can

699
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,760
do

700
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
edge detecting type things and you can

701
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,120
really get more and more sophisticated

702
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,840
as you tweak

703
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
the specific values of this kernel it's

704
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
a really powerful tool

705
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,840
beyond just a moving average many of you

706
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,039
may have heard of the idea of a

707
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,960
convolutional neural network

708
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,440
this is in a context where what you want

709
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,720
is for a machine to learn

710
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,799
specific kernels so rather than hand

711
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,760
baking one like

712
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
handing it a gaussian or handing it a

713
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,679
sobel instead you try to have it learn

714
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,120
which kernels are going to pull out some

715
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,280
meaningful information from an image

716
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,760
so it's a very good building block to

717
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
add up on top of all of that

718
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
now one thing to point out while we're

719
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,039
looking at this

720
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,840
sobo filter is unlike the other ones

721
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,880
it's asymmetric

722
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,559
so that it looks different on the left

723
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,240
than it does on the right whereas

724
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,720
a simple gaussian blur or a box blur it

725
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
doesn't matter how you rotate it

726
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
and you might think this doesn't matter

727
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,559
but it does end up highlighting

728
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,919
a different convention that you'll

729
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,720
sometimes find so

730
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,200
in mathematical contexts instead of

731
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,559
doing the thing that you would expect

732
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
which is having this kernel actively

733
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,919
march across the image

734
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,000
we often think of whatever the uh

735
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,280
convolved term is

736
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
as being rotated around so i'll show you

737
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
what i mean if we have over here

738
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,159
we've got our kernel it's marching along

739
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,840
the image what you actually want to

740
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,600
imagine the the picture to actually hold

741
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,320
in your head

742
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,640
for convolutions in a mathematical

743
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,720
setting is to basically flip it entirely

744
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,440
around

745
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,120
so if the original kernel had the green

746
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,799
on the right and the red on the left

747
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,400
really you're kind of flipping it around

748
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,919
before you have it march across the

749
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,559
image

750
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,760
and then do the same thing where you

751
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
multiply corresponding terms and you add

752
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,039
them all up

753
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,440
and at first that might seem like a very

754
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,640
strange thing to do

755
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,880
why would the convention in any context

756
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
work out like that

757
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
and indeed in some image processing ones

758
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,679
they just define convolutions to do the

759
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,960
thing that you would expect

760
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
um but i do want to take a little moment

761
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
to explain why you sometimes see it this

762
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,280
way

763
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
and why it actually gives you these

764
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,799
really nice mathematical properties

765
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,480
i don't know if i'll have uh full time

766
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,640
to delve into the details here

767
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
but we're going to start by talking

768
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
about something that seems

769
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,600
totally unrelated to image processing

770
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,039
which is to multiply two different

771
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,280
polynomials together so for this one let

772
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,960
me actually pop back to our live quiz

773
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
and just have you do a little bit of

774
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,280
active thinking

775
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,320
so the question asks that you

776
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
consider the following expression you've

777
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,080
got a certain polynomial term

778
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,200
whose coefficients are k0 k1 k2 and then

779
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,799
we're multiplying it by an infinite

780
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,480
series okay just an infinite power

781
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,200
series

782
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,320
with different um powers of x in there

783
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,760
and it wants you to just look at one

784
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,679
specific term what is the constant for

785
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,559
the x cubed

786
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,880
term okay so think about that you know

787
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
choose your answer as you're thinking

788
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
about that

789
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
maybe i'll start talking through how

790
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,280
you'd multiply this out

791
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
and again this might seem extremely

792
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,960
unrelated to image processing

793
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,280
and it's actually um it's actually

794
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,400
closer than you might think

795
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,080
for reasons that i hope to be able to

796
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,919
get into but a half hour is an awfully

797
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,360
short time for a lecture i do have to

798
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,480
say

799
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,520
so k zero times a one

800
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,799
is just going to give you the constant

801
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,720
term any other pair of terms that you

802
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,600
have in here

803
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,080
isn't going to uh is going to involve

804
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,120
some kind of x

805
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
so if we try to organize things in terms

806
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,320
of what their constants are

807
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,360
you know we've got uh just

808
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
simple term for the constant and then if

809
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
you start thinking about what's the term

810
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,880
in front of

811
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,760
x well we can take k0 times a1 and then

812
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,200
k1 times a0

813
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,720
those are the two things in the product

814
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,559
they're going to result in x just to the

815
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,919
power of one

816
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,840
and you know i think a lot of you kind

817
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
of know how to do this we're just doing

818
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,640
a foil basically between two different

819
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,000
polynomials one of them just

820
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,559
happens to be infinite and you know the

821
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,919
next term is going to be the

822
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,600
answer to the live quiz so let me go

823
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,679
ahead and pop over there

824
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,559
see what most people are saying here so

825
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,000
it looks like we've got

826
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,120
92 93 people answering correctly

827
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,000
um that it's a which basically is just

828
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,760
marching through all of the pairs so

829
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
that the index on the k

830
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,440
added together with the index on the a

831
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
is equal to three

832
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
and uh those of you who answered b it's

833
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
like completely in the right thought

834
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,440
it's just that we're multiplying by a

835
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
quadratic um polynomial instead of

836
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,799
multiplying by

837
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
something that goes on forever as well

838
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
so there is no k3 term

839
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
that's the that's the only distractor in

840
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,679
that one question

841
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,799
and so you know you know how this goes

842
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,520
we've got

843
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
various different terms that we could

844
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
get it's a nice big product

845
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,880
a way that you could think about

846
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
multiplying two polynomials like this

847
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,799
that's actually heavy heavily related

848
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,159
now to

849
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,520
all the ideas that we were just talking

850
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,840
about is i'm going to take a copy of

851
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
that polynomial

852
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,760
and then i'm going to take this

853
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,279
quadratic but i want a copy of the

854
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,640
quadratic which is

855
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,440
turned around so i'm putting the k2 term

856
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,120
on the left and then the k0 term on the

857
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,080
right

858
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
we could imagine doing exactly what the

859
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
little kernel for our image was doing

860
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,880
just having it march across

861
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
where first here we we align the k zero

862
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,880
with the a0 terms

863
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
we multiply them and then we have it

864
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,159
march one further

865
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,799
and we align the k1 with the a0 and the

866
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,559
k0 with the a1

867
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,240
multiply the corresponding terms and add

868
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
them together and that's

869
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
exactly what we get for our next term

870
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,760
here then we have it march along once

871
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,559
more

872
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,080
play the same game multiply

873
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,679
corresponding terms add them all

874
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,039
together

875
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,960
and what you see is that the terms in

876
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
the new polynomial

877
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,880
could be described as a convolution

878
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
between the terms

879
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,880
in the original polynomials that we had

880
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
but notice that in order for that to

881
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,480
work we needed this convention where

882
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
one of the polynomials was flipped

883
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
around before you do this marching

884
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
process

885
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,919
so because that's how it comes up in a

886
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,840
lot of mathematical contexts this ends

887
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,440
up being a convention

888
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,919
more broadly but it does actually have a

889
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,440
little bit of um

890
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,120
influence on on the image processing

891
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,720
context because there's a heavy analogy

892
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,600
here between

893
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,760
the values k in some little polynomial

894
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,039
and the values of our kernel

895
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,640
and then thinking of all of these values

896
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
a as being kind of like

897
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
pixel values right except instead of

898
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
storing them in different spots

899
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,360
it's kind of like we're storing them

900
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,159
next to an associated power of x

901
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,440
now that might seem like a strange thing

902
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,039
to do with pixels and indeed we never

903
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,559
really do that with pixels

904
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,720
but one thing that we actually do do is

905
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
take a um

906
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,559
a slight variation of this where instead

907
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,320
of multiplying each pixel value

908
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,279
by x we might multiply it by this e to

909
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:45,919
the two pi

910
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,159
i times some sort of frequency term and

911
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,840
as we take the power of that

912
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,760
you get this thing that rotates across

913
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,360
and it lets you pull out frequency

914
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,640
information from the uh

915
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,840
image now i'm not expecting uh people

916
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,440
watching this to necessarily know

917
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
about fourier transforms or fourier

918
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,960
series if you want to know

919
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,320
you know i hear there's a youtube

920
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,840
channel that covers some of these topics

921
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,320
that

922
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
you could watch some of the videos of

923
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,880
but at a very high level i do want to

924
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,159
try to finish the lecture showing you

925
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:12,720
something

926
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,360
really cool about convolutions and about

927
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,480
making them more

928
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,000
computationally efficient than you might

929
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,919
think is possible and the only things

930
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,200
you need to know about

931
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,080
fourier transforms is we're doing

932
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,159
something very analogous to power series

933
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,919
and then mathematically it behaves very

934
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:28,880
similarly

935
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,320
so all we're doing is taking these

936
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
values and multiplying them by something

937
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,240
it's not x but it's something that we

938
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,919
have successive powers of

939
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,760
and what that means is that if we do

940
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,440
that to two different

941
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,000
arrays to two different collections of

942
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,120
values

943
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,919
multiplying the two results corresponds

944
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,720
to convolving the original terms

945
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
so for example right when we take the

946
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,799
polynomial that was generated by k

947
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,480
and we multiply it by the polynomial

948
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,799
that was generated by these a terms

949
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,039
we get a new polynomial where each term

950
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,000
is a convolution between a and k

951
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,760
same thing would happen if we replaced x

952
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,360
with something um

953
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
like this e to the two pi i stuff all of

954
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,080
the terms from one

955
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,840
if you take this collection of the terms

956
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,880
from one what's going to be called the

957
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,799
fourier transform of that thing

958
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,399
and you multiply it by the fourier

959
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,840
transform of the other

960
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
it corresponds to convolving the

961
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
original terms now this will be a little

962
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,559
bit easier to see if we

963
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,799
just again actually pull up a notebook

964
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,320
and play around with it

965
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,039
so what i'm going to do is let's just

966
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,399
remind ourselves what the image looked

967
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:30,720
like

968
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,080
this was the cat and i've just written a

969
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,720
very simple

970
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,760
plot 1d fourier spectrum

971
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
oh asking me to update my software in

972
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,000
the middle of a lecture

973
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,679
how rude all right so

974
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,240
uh again i'm not necessarily expecting

975
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,279
everyone to know

976
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,960
what a fourier transform is but at a

977
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,559
high level i want to be able to describe

978
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,240
what information about the image it's

979
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
pulling out so

980
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
tom the cat is a rather soft image with

981
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,919
not a lot of variation happening from

982
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,960
left to right

983
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,679
so if i go through and i try to ask um

984
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,520
you know is there very very fine detail

985
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,000
a lot of

986
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,080
high frequency changes happening as we

987
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,600
move from left to right

988
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
there's not necessarily going to be a

989
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
lot of information there

990
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,880
now i don't know why

991
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
this is taking as long as it is to

992
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,559
process

993
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,159
all right maybe it had to pre-compile

994
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,039
the function for the first time

995
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,559
but tom doesn't actually produce a very

996
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,159
interesting fourier transform and he

997
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,360
doesn't give a good in

998
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,279
uh instinct for what information is

999
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,039
being pulled out so what we could do

1000
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,919
instead

1001
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,840
i'll go ahead and get rid of his uh

1002
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
convolution term there

1003
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,799
is take a more interesting image so i've

1004
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,600
prepared one

1005
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,039
that's just a herd of zebra

1006
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,360
so this heard of zebra we've got lots of

1007
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,960
stripes as you move from the left to the

1008
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,760
right

1009
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,440
kernel by the way i'm just going to

1010
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,600
prepare ourselves a gaussian kernel here

1011
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
let's get a gaussian that's maybe you

1012
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,640
know this nine by nine thing

1013
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
if we look at the uh this fourier

1014
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
information associated with the image

1015
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,480
the only thing i want you to notice is

1016
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,799
that as you go away from zero

1017
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,880
you actually have higher values so for

1018
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,320
example it kind of peaks up

1019
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,799
a little above 50 here which almost

1020
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,559
certainly corresponds with the frequency

1021
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,919
of the stripes themselves

1022
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,799
as we move from left to right now the

1023
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,080
reason i bring all of this up

1024
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,600
is to try to highlight what happens when

1025
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,399
we take the convolution of this image

1026
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,960
okay so i'm going to create a new image

1027
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,279
called conv-m

1028
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,000
that's going to convolve the image with

1029
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,960
that kernel

1030
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,000
which we define to be a gaussian and

1031
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,679
as you expect it's a blurrier version of

1032
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,279
the of the zebras

1033
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,960
but now if we do the same thing we plot

1034
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,520
this 1d fourier spectrum

1035
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,440
but we do it on the convolved version of

1036
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,840
the image what we get looks very similar

1037
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,559
to the original

1038
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,840
but notice how what's happening around

1039
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
the edges have been pushed down

1040
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
and that's a way of saying all the high

1041
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,360
frequency stuff happening with the image

1042
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,799
all that finer detail

1043
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,360
is no longer there so now it's behaving

1044
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,880
a lot more like the image of the cat

1045
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,200
that was soft all around

1046
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,399
and there's actually something much more

1047
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,480
specific that's happening here where

1048
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
it turns out that the uh the fourier

1049
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,799
transform of this

1050
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,519
gaussian kernel is another gaussian

1051
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,559
curve

1052
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,919
specifically in such a way that if you

1053
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,279
have a really narrow gaussian the

1054
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,080
fourier transform

1055
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,519
is something really broad if you have a

1056
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,960
broad one it gives you something really

1057
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,080
narrow

1058
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,799
and if we just look at the gauss the the

1059
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,559
fourier information just the frequency

1060
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,360
information

1061
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,919
and we multiply it by a bell curve kind

1062
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,440
of squishing down what's at the outer

1063
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,399
regions

1064
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
that gets us the same fourier

1065
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,679
information

1066
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,120
and remember how a little bit earlier i

1067
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,799
was talking about the computational

1068
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,640
complexity here how as we have a really

1069
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,519
big kernel

1070
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,840
it requires a lot of multiplications it

1071
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,600
turns out if instead we

1072
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,440
first translate things to describing it

1073
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,519
in terms of the frequencies of the image

1074
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,880
where convolution is just like

1075
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
multiplication so we can just

1076
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,200
multiply the two functions as functions

1077
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
just pixel by pixel

1078
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,480
and then we take it back it gives us a

1079
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,279
much faster way to do this operation

1080
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,559
and given that this is a course about

1081
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,240
computational thinking i think you know

1082
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,919
there is a certain general principle to

1083
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:06,880
be had in that

1084
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,320
where finding different ways to

1085
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,240
represent your information actually can

1086
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,559
sometimes help you do things much faster

1087
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,640
now here i'm plotting just um a very

1088
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,840
one-dimensional thing it's kind of

1089
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
marching across the image from left to

1090
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,919
right

1091
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,960
but we could uh show what did i write

1092
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,360
like heat map 2d fourier spectrum and

1093
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,799
again i'll share this notebook if you

1094
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,559
want to play with it

1095
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,399
um we can do kind of a two-dimensional

1096
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,679
analog

1097
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,039
where the information that comes out of

1098
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
this again i think it has to pre-compile

1099
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,720
it

1100
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,640
is essentially saying what's the level

1101
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,760
of detail happening

1102
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
both in the vertical and horizontal

1103
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,440
direction so in this context

1104
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,600
you know we get this strange galactic

1105
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,559
image

1106
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,559
and if we apply it to the smoothed out

1107
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,080
version

1108
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,600
the convolved image uh not con

1109
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,399
image conv image what we see is that it

1110
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,080
actually pushes down the values

1111
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,679
that are far away and concentrates us

1112
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,760
towards the center and just to kind of

1113
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,279
see the contrast if we had started off

1114
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,880
with a much softer image

1115
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,640
started off with something like tom

1116
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,559
he's soft to begin with this uh

1117
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,240
this fourier spectrum which again it's

1118
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
okay if it's not crystal clear what it's

1119
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,799
supposed to represent

1120
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,320
all i want you to know is that the

1121
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,840
farther away you are from the center

1122
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,039
the brightness of those values

1123
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
corresponds to the level of detail

1124
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,399
happening

1125
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,000
that this is what like a softer image

1126
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
looks like and as you multiply by

1127
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,480
a gaussian in this fourier space it

1128
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
pushes you towards this smoother looking

1129
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,440
spectrum

1130
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,760
and that's a much faster operation so

1131
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,519
often in the standard libraries for

1132
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,519
convolutions they don't do the naive

1133
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,120
thing when you have a large kernel

1134
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,799
instead they do this more sophisticated

1135
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,320
thing

1136
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,519
and again you can see kind of what

1137
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
effect this has had so here the version

1138
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,279
of the function convolved that i wrote

1139
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:47,919
by the way

1140
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,440
it's not doing the sophisticated thing

1141
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,600
it's just doing the naive you have the

1142
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
little grid of values march across and

1143
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,760
you have them uh multiply and add as you

1144
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,240
need

1145
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
and you'll be doing that in the problem

1146
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
set uh this week

1147
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,279
so uh i think oh man a half hour is such

1148
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,000
a short time

1149
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
all right i've already run out uh but

1150
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,519
that is the basics of

1151
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,919
image convolutions and the main thing i

1152
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,119
want you to take away here

1153
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,760
is a a simple tool that seemed like it

1154
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,200
was specific at first where we were just

1155
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,480
doing moving averages

1156
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,320
if you abstract in the right way right

1157
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,000
you write it so that rather than just

1158
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,520
hard coding all of the moving average

1159
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,079
functionality you take it out where

1160
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,760
this general convolution principle can

1161
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
be applied as its own and we tweak

1162
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
some data we tweak the kernel that lets

1163
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,200
you do qualitatively different things

1164
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,159
with your data

1165
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,679
so in this case it let us do things like

1166
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,679
blurring like sharpening like edge

1167
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,800
detecting

1168
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,240
and then the other thing is that when

1169
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,800
you represent your data in distinct ways

1170
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,359
so uh in this context if we were taking

1171
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,240
the fourier

1172
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,599
information taking this frequency

1173
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
information sometimes that actually lets

1174
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,000
you do things

1175
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,320
much faster even though you're doing

1176
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,200
under the hood

1177
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,040
um well not under the hood like in the

1178
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,960
abstract sense you're doing the same

1179
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,240
operations on the data

1180
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,640
one domain can often be different from

1181
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,720
another and how it behaves

1182
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
so with that i'm going to call it an

1183
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,839
into this first lecture

1184
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,680
um for the mit students in the course

1185
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,440
we're going to do uh like a zoom call

1186
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,040
that's basically the profs um

1187
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,880
just discussing more of this material in

1188
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,040
person so you can interact there

1189
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,800
as always there's the discord so please

1190
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
do jump into the discord ask questions

1191
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,200
have discussion

1192
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
and i will see you next week and enjoy

1193
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:30,050
the first problem set

1194
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,689
[Music]

1195
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,439
[Music]

1196
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:55,739
[Music]

1197
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,710
do

1198
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:09,520
[Music]

1199
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
