<p begin="00:00:04.560" end="00:00:08.000" style="s2">hello and welcome to the first live</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.640" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">lecture of the course</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:11.200" style="s2">so before we jump into things there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:13.360" style="s2">just a couple logistics to</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.200" end="00:00:15.040" style="s2">uh handle here the first one is that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.360" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">have a new website so if you check the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.040" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">link in the description</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:20.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a new official course website uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:21.279" style="s2">and again this is something that anybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.560" end="00:00:22.960" style="s2">in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.279" end="00:00:25.119" style="s2">free to attend the lectures for if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.960" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">want to second we&#39;re going to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.119" end="00:00:28.160" style="s2">the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:29.920" style="s2">during this lecture through discord so</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.160" end="00:00:31.519" style="s2">if you want to answer questions or ask</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.920" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">questions or interact with the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.519" end="00:00:35.200" style="s2">professors</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:36.320" style="s2">while i give this lecture the discord&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.200" end="00:00:38.239" style="s2">the place to do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:39.760" style="s2">um questions will be fed to me and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.239" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">can pull them up on screen here</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.760" end="00:00:43.360" style="s2">so for example it looks like last time</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:44.719" style="s2">there were some people asking about some</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.360" end="00:00:45.520" style="s2">of the functions i was using in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.719" end="00:00:47.360" style="s2">notebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.520" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">uh which i failed to mention were custom</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.360" end="00:00:50.559" style="s2">defined within that notebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">so if you just try and like open raw</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.559" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">julia to call destinate</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:55.199" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean anything but it was just</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">this small little custom thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.199" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">and in general we&#39;ll share the notebooks</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:00:59.840" style="s2">that we&#39;re using so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:01.120" style="s2">follow along you can see all those</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.840" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">pre-definitions</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.120" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">um and with that you know we only have</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.039" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">30 minutes for this lecture</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">convolutions are super interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">let you do a bunch of powerful things</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">so i say let us just jump right into</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:15.280" style="s2">so as a first example i&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">take this 8-bit mario</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.280" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">that we see this very low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:21.040" style="s2">image and i want to blur it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:22.400" style="s2">and if you&#39;re thinking about blurring an</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">image maybe the first thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.400" end="00:01:25.759" style="s2">could think to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:27.759" style="s2">would be to look at each pixel and kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.759" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">of average it with all of its neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.759" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">and do this sort of moving average so</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">the way i&#39;m doing it here we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">little grid</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">uh three by three grid of values that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">marching across the image</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">and slowly creating a new image on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">right and to be concrete what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">on here is each of those values is 1 9</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re sort of thinking of lining</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">them up with some pixels multiplying</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">each of those values by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">corresponding pixel</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.360" style="s2">and then adding them together so in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:54.640" style="s2">case if they&#39;re all 1 9 then we multiply</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">them and we add them together</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.640" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">we&#39;re just taking an average of the nine</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">pixels so in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">specific window it looks like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">four black pixels</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">four gray pixels and then one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">kind of the mario skin tone color</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">so you would expect the average to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">like a darker gray with the tiniest</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">you know hint of mario skin color and if</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">we go and look at the new</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">image that&#39;s being generated and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">painted into that pixel</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s a dark gray with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">tiniest hint of some kind of skin color</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">and as we keep marching along we get</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">this blurrier image of mario we might</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">zoom in on another example</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">um here you know this grid it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">covering the skin color with just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">little bit of black</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">here and there so we would expect it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">be a dyed down version of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">which is what we see um and he&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">gives kind of a nice effect right</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">we zoom out and we see uh what was once</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">this nice clean</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">8-bit mario same resolution uh nothing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">changed about the resolution but what</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">we&#39;ve got is kind of this blurrier image</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">now a couple nuances about what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">on here because</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">uh as with so many things in computer</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">science there&#39;s edge cases to handle</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">in this case it&#39;s a literal edge case</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">like what&#39;s going on at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">because if we just let this grid of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">values fall off the side</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">and you know maybe we either don&#39;t count</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">them or we&#39;re multiplying them by zero</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">what ends up happening is we would only</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">be taking four ninths</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">of the given corner value and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">to end up disproportionately dark</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">which in some mathematical contexts</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what you want you would</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">want to treat the image as being</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">something where</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">outside of a certain domain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">entirely zero</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">but when our eyes look at the blurred</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">image it doesn&#39;t quite seem right</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">because you see all of this black</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">or this sort of darker gray along the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">side and what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">expect is that this was an image taken</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">in a broader context where what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">you know mario&#39;s world is the same gray</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">that we would have thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">so in the problem set for today&#39;s uh not</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">today&#39;s lecture for this week&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">uh lectures you&#39;ve got well you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">the task of basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">defining a function that will handle</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">this and a more general variety of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">and one thing to think about is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">happens at that edge and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">a typical convention in image processing</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">context would be that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">when you&#39;re falling off the edge like</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">that you uh you just</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">uh multiply by the nearest value right</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">so if you see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">1 9 times 0 instead of falling off the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">edge you take the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">the nearest value in the image and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">would make the boundary of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">mario look a lot more gray so that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">well and good</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s another nuance that we might</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">want to handle here which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">you know if we&#39;re not in a super low</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">resolution context like this but if</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">something that&#39;s higher resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">we want to have a box that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">bit bigger</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">like maybe i have this 5x5 box that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">wandering along</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit strange to treat all</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">of the pixels in that 5x5 box with equal</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">weight</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">because the ones towards the center are</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">somehow more representative of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">going on in that image</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">at that point than the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">farther around</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">so for this example what i&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">done if we zoom in here um</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">is i&#39;ve given a grid of values that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">aren&#39;t all the same you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">all 1 divided by 25 in this case</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">but the middle one is 0.162 and out at</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">farther regions we&#39;ve got 0.003</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">so when we multiply those by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">corresponding pixel values and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">add them all together</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">we&#39;re basically taking a weighted sum</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">weighted according to how close to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">center it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a way of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">okay it&#39;s okay for this pixel here to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">influenced by what&#39;s at the outer corner</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">but only by a little bit you know we</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we shouldn&#39;t get into it too</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">these specific values are coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">gaussian curve also known as a bell</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">so you might imagine kind of this bell</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">curve surface sitting on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.840" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s bulging right above the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">that we want and then it dissipates in</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">as you go away from that and that gets</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">us a much nicer notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">uh averaging the pixels so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">like i said it&#39;s taking into account how</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">close they are to the point we want</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">the gaussian specifically has some</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">really nice mathematical properties that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">we might talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">a little later on in this lecture that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">makes it really really quite nice for</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">doing this kind of operation</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">now this operation that we&#39;re doing as</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">you can infer from the title of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">video and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">uh everything about this and what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">talked about last time</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a convolution what you would say is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">that the image on the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">the resulting values that we get are a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">convolution of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">the original image with the little grid</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">of values that we have here</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s an operation that takes in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">at least in an image processing context</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">two different grids of values maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">is rgb maybe one is numbers</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">they could both be numbers and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">combines them to get a new grid of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">in other mathematical contexts we often</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">think of it as combining two functions</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.160" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">to get a new function</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">and when you&#39;re doing it with uh just</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">this little smaller window</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">it&#39;s quite common to refer to it as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">kernel so in this case we would say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">we convolved mario with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">gaussian kernel okay and at this point</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">you might sit back and think okay you</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">know that&#39;s all well and good i guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">different kinds of averages i could get</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">different sorts of blurring effects</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">going on in the images and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">you know i guess there&#39;s some use cases</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">for blurring images like blurring out</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">faces</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">but it goes way beyond that actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:03.919" style="s2">first of all smoothing out an image with</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">a gaussian kernel</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">is useful in a lot of contexts beyond</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">what you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">but the important thing i want you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">keep in mind here is not the specific</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">but um the general framework that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">being developed</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">where if we tweak what the values inside</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">that kernel are</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">we can start to do some more nuanced and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">interesting things with images</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">and to get to that you know i say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">just dive right into actually coding up</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">some examples here</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">so um i&#39;m just going to be creating a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">little pluto notebook like i did last</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">time here</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">and uh right now i&#39;ve prepared it with</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">an image so i&#39;ve created a large image</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">is loading a certain image of tom the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">cat</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">and then i&#39;ve shrunk it down mostly just</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">so that it&#39;s easier to see on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">but also that makes some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">faster to play with so if we just check</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">the size of the image</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">it&#39;s now a very small 500 by 399</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">and again by the way if any of you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">and you do so in the discord some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">them will be like forwarded in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">direction and i&#39;ll try to keep my eye on</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">if any of those have come in so feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">free to just do that whenever</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">and um oh i&#39;m told my mic is peaking a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">so let me let me just turn that down a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">little bit give you a better</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">uh sound experience hopefully it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">too unpleasant in any ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">it&#39;s always so finicky to get these live</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">streams to work properly</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">but we want to actually do this uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">convolving operation right we want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">actually see what happens when we mess</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">around with different kernels</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">so first of all to get a given kernel</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">there&#39;s this library that i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve got all of our definitions down</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">here for various functions i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m going to be using one called</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">image filtering and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">it it has this module called kernel</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">and we can pull up the documentation for</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">it you know just using the live docs</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">where it tells us the various different</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">functions it has in there and among them</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">is this gaussian which is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">you want but it already tells you that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">there&#39;s more interesting kernels that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">can be played with</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">and if i create a gaussian and i specify</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">two different standard deviations one in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">the x direction one in the y direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">what it gives me is a grid of values so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">we take a look and this type is a five</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">by five</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">offset array okay so essentially it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">array of floats</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">but the offset just means that um the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">way that you index into it</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">let&#39;s give it a name like kernel</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.600" style="s2">is such that the middle value is at zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">zero so if i called kernel of zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.600" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">zero i get that middle value that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">actually saw in the animation point one</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">six two</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">um and then if we take you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">something like negative two which</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t index at zero much</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">less below zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">uh with julia arrays in this context</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">it&#39;s specifically offset</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t matter too much just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">to say in case you were wondering what</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">that term means</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:50.720" style="s2">what we actually want is a nice way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">take a look at what this kernel is</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.720" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">so i wrote a very simple function just</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">called show colored kernel</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">that&#39;s basically pulling out the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">positive part and making it green</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">and then if a kernel has negative part</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">it&#39;s going to pull it out as red</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">so you can take a look at the details if</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">you want for that later</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">but all i want is for you to think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this little grid of values</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">that&#39;s very peaked at one point and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">kind of dissipates out</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have it march along the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">image of the cat here</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">and what&#39;s that gonna do and you already</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.279" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">know what it&#39;s going to do because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">played around with mario</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">but the idea is that as we tweak what</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">this kernel is we&#39;ll get some more</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">so what you will write in the problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">set this week is a function called</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">convolve</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">it will do exactly this it&#39;ll take in an</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">image it&#39;ll take in this kernel of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">and it&#39;ll produce a new image which in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">this context</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">is a little bit blurrier now because</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">this is a small kernel</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s not as visible but</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">if i changed it to be a gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">with standard deviation 3 the library is</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">smart and it knows to make it</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">a little bit bigger if i want it to so</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">now it&#39;s a 13 by 13</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">array and we see that it indeed does</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">make it notably blurrier</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">and we could go to an extreme we could</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">say you know i want the standard</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">deviation to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">quite a bit larger so maybe 10 by 10</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">and this gets me a much larger array so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">that little gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">curve that we&#39;re imagining marching</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">along the image that would now be 41 by</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:11.360" style="s2">41</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">and the result that you get is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.360" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">every pixel is really influenced by a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">lot around it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">very much like you took a lens and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">um you unfocused the image</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">now while we&#39;re here and because this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">a class about computational thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">let&#39;s think a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">computational complexity because</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">in order to process that image there</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">julia&#39;s generally pretty fast</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">um but this took 9.5 seconds now a big</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">part of that is maybe because i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">this convolved function</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">less efficiently than it could be we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">talk later this lecture about</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">like very clever things that are done to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">make it more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">but just in principle if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">like actively think about how many</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">operations are taking place here</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a fun little exercise to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">about because the size of our image</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">right it looks like it&#39;s not too big</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">it&#39;s 500 by 399. which means if we take</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">the product of those two values let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">give that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">the number of pixels um so if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">multiply that by</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">the number of values in the kernel so</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">the product</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">for the size array on the kernel</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">it&#39;s actually quite a few different</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">multiplications that have to happen</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:14.959" style="s2">through this whole process because</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.959" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">every time that little window is sitting</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">on top of a pixel you&#39;re multiplying all</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">of those neighboring values and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">you&#39;re adding them up</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">so in this context it looks like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">got you know thousand million</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">just for one simple small image like 300</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">million multiplications have to happen</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s just a thing to think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">here is that as the kernel gets larger</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:37.279" style="s2">it unless you do something clever it</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">will by default take a lot longer to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">process images especially if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">higher resolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">but before we talk about how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">diminish that kind of complexity let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">just play around with what happens if i</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">change this kernel</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">so actually before i even show you i</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">think i want to do this as a live quiz</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">so that might be a little bit fun where</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">um we were doing a couple of these in</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">the intro animation just</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">some warm-up questions but as the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">real question</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">uh i&#39;m going to give you a sample kernel</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">okay i&#39;m not going to show you what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">does or tell you what it does</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">but i want you to actually try to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">about what this would do</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s going to be a little 3x3</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">grid and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">it&#39;s got a lot of negative values around</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">the boundary and the center value is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">7.</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s going to be seven at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">center and then some negative values</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">around it</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">specifically one for the immediately</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">adjacent neighbors and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">negative point five for all of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:32.120" style="s2">around it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">and uh at this point if you go to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.120" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">itempool.com3b1b</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">live you can place a vote we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">the statistics on how other people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">answering</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m actually genuinely curious</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">uh will say to this one so this is going</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">well maybe i shouldn&#39;t say that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious from the context the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">blurring isn&#39;t going to be the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">but while you while you answer that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">going to go ahead and type that up</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">into our notebook just to have prepared</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">and also while you answer it think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.600" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">aspects of this kernel you could try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">compute</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">to get a loose sense of how it would</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">behave in different uh regions of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">you know if it&#39;s in a monochromatic</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">region what does it look like if it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">a region where there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">what does it look like like try to try</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.760" end="00:14:25.279" style="s2">to think through some examples in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:25.279" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably around the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">time i want to spend</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">although let&#39;s let&#39;s just take a look if</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">there&#39;s any questions in the doc</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">to uh to answer while we&#39;re waiting</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">is it possible to reconstruct the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">original image from the blurred one</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think so um</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting question we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">have to ask the other professor i</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t think so because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">can take this to an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">where uh it feels like you&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">losing out on information</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">there&#39;s other things that you can do to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">it though like the fast fourier</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">transform would be an example where you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">can recover the image exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">but those feel like you know very rare i</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say that offhandedly</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know quite off the top of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:11.760" style="s2">head one of the other props who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">smarter than i</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.760" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">might come in to answer um and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">second one</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">uh how does convolving an image with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">kernel directly relate to convolving two</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">glad that you asked that um i&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">about that in just a little bit actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">relationship between image processing</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">definition of convolution is and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">how you see it in some other</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">mathematical contexts</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s essentially the same idea though</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">that you have one thing that&#39;s marching</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">across another</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">you multiply corresponding values and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">then you add them up</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really the same operation</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:43.279" style="s2">modulo like one or two small conventions</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">all right so if we go back to our quiz</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.279" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">see what the answers turn out to be here</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">fascinating so it looks like most people</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">thought that it would detect edges</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">but if we actually play with this if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:59.199" style="s2">go to our notebook here</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">and i&#39;ve gone ahead and written in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.199" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">kernel so</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">that same grid of values that i gave you</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">where seven in the center and then some</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">negatives around</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">the effect that it has on the picture of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">the cat here is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">kind of sharpens it up so if we look</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">previously his chest is very fluffy very</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">soft</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">but over here what it&#39;s done is really</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">accentuated the differences between one</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">piece of fur in the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">now for those of you who did answer edge</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">detecting you&#39;re definitely on the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">track</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">uh but one small thing that you could do</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">to kind of check what the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">this kernel might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">is to notice uh what the sum of all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">those values are</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">the spelling kernel here so if we add</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">them all up they equal one</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">which is much the same that you would do</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">with any kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">weighted average if you have all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">weights they&#39;ve got to be one</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">and what that means is that if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">a region of the image without any edges</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">okay you&#39;re in like a totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">monochromatic spot if you add up all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">the values and you&#39;re multiplying them</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">and the sum for the kernel is one well</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:58.000" style="s2">that means that you&#39;re just going to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">the original color back</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.000" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">the circumstances under which this does</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">something non-obvious</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:05.120" style="s2">are when there&#39;s a lot of variation near</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">a point so if you have one point that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.120" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">um let&#39;s say a very bright pixel</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">and then it&#39;s surrounded by very dark</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">pixels that will end up looking quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">bright because the dark ones aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">subtracting off in the way that other</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:18.799" style="s2">now if you want to think about edge</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">detection stuff there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.799" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">standard kernels that we might play with</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">for that so one of the simplest</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">would be what&#39;s called a sobel kernel</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">and in this context it&#39;s yelling at us</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">because what it returns isn&#39;t actually a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">single kernel but a pair of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">so i might pull out just one or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">the second index</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">um and let&#39;s let&#39;s go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">visualize this kernel see</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">first of all we&#39;ve got that the sum is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">zero so that&#39;s telling us something</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">let me do my show colored kernel</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">great so we see it&#39;s got positive values</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">on the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s got negative values on the left</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">but crucially</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">now if we add up all of those values it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">comes up to zero so if you would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">taking this kernel and you put it over a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">monochromatic part of the image</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">it&#39;s going to come out completely black</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">which sort of matches with what we see</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">here where</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">at first it looks like it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">turning the image black but</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">let&#39;s think a little bit more about what</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">we would expect this specific kernel to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">so if we&#39;ve got our image in mind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">taking you know a specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">little grid of values and what are we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">doing we&#39;re just kind of marching it</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">across the image</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">what would you expect to be required for</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:29.679" style="s2">this to end up as a positive number well</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">if we&#39;re adding up some positive values</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">on the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">and then we&#39;re subtracting off whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">they multiply on the left</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">then if you have some region where it</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">goes from being very dark</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">to being very bright that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">where you get positive values</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">but notice you can also get negative</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">values here if you had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">brightness on the left</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">and then a lot of darkness on the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">what this convolution would give you</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">is a negative value so that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">just because we&#39;re displaying these</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">convolutions as rgb images</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s always the right way</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">to see it because in this context when</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve convolved</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">our fluffy cat with something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">occasionally puts out negative values</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">the way that the rgb type is going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">treat that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">not necessarily going to be displayed in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">a way that shows everything that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">so what i could do instead is take an</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">absolute value of everything happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">not an absolute value of the convolution</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got our convolution take an</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">absolute value</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">of what&#39;s sitting there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">basically if i take the absolute value</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">of an rgb</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">it&#39;s um treating it like a vector</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">getting the norm this gives us a grid of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">i still want to see it as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">colors so i&#39;m going to tell pluto hey</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">i want you to think of these as</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">grayscale values</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">and i might even scale them up a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">bit just because i&#39;m especially not sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">how the youtube compression is handling</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">this all</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">but this will really just accentuate out</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">all of the points where</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">this sobolfilter convolved across the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">image ends up non-zero</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">and what you see is all of the points</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">where there&#39;s a lot of micro variations</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">as you move uh from left to right kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">of like the uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:05.440" style="s2">you know the different color fur that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">happens on the chest</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">that&#39;s where you start to get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">and if we take the other thing that this</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">kernel.sobel returned</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">it basically gives us the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">version of that okay so as you move</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">up and down for example right around the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">whiskers that&#39;s going to be where you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">get a lot of this variation</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">convolution of the image with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">kernel something non-zero so the point</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">here is that you know you can do</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:31.760" style="s2">blurring you can do sharpening you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.760" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">edge detecting type things and you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">really get more and more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">as you tweak</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">the specific values of this kernel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">a really powerful tool</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">beyond just a moving average many of you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">may have heard of the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">convolutional neural network</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">this is in a context where what you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">is for a machine to learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">specific kernels so rather than hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">baking one like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">handing it a gaussian or handing it a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">sobel instead you try to have it learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">which kernels are going to pull out some</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">meaningful information from an image</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very good building block to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">add up on top of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">now one thing to point out while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">sobo filter is unlike the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">it&#39;s asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">so that it looks different on the left</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">than it does on the right whereas</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">a simple gaussian blur or a box blur it</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how you rotate it</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:22.559" style="s2">and you might think this doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">but it does end up highlighting</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.559" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">a different convention that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">sometimes find so</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">in mathematical contexts instead of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">doing the thing that you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">which is having this kernel actively</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">march across the image</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">we often think of whatever the uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">convolved term is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">as being rotated around so i&#39;ll show you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:42.159" style="s2">what i mean if we have over here</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:43.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve got our kernel it&#39;s marching along</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">the image what you actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.840" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">imagine the the picture to actually hold</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">in your head</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">for convolutions in a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">setting is to basically flip it entirely</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">so if the original kernel had the green</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">on the right and the red on the left</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">really you&#39;re kind of flipping it around</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">before you have it march across the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">and then do the same thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">multiply corresponding terms and you add</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">them all up</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:06.640" style="s2">and at first that might seem like a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">strange thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.640" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">why would the convention in any context</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">work out like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">and indeed in some image processing ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">they just define convolutions to do the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">thing that you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">um but i do want to take a little moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">to explain why you sometimes see it this</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">and why it actually gives you these</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">really nice mathematical properties</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll have uh full time</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">to delve into the details here</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to start by talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">about something that seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">totally unrelated to image processing</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">which is to multiply two different</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">polynomials together so for this one let</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">me actually pop back to our live quiz</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">and just have you do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:46.320" style="s2">active thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">so the question asks that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.320" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">consider the following expression you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">got a certain polynomial term</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">whose coefficients are k0 k1 k2 and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">we&#39;re multiplying it by an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">series okay just an infinite power</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">with different um powers of x in there</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">and it wants you to just look at one</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">specific term what is the constant for</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">the x cubed</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">term okay so think about that you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">choose your answer as you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">maybe i&#39;ll start talking through how</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">you&#39;d multiply this out</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">and again this might seem extremely</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:19.280" style="s2">unrelated to image processing</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually um it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.280" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">closer than you might think</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">for reasons that i hope to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">get into but a half hour is an awfully</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">short time for a lecture i do have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">so k zero times a one</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">is just going to give you the constant</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">term any other pair of terms that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">have in here</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to uh is going to involve</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">some kind of x</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">so if we try to organize things in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">of what their constants are</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve got uh just</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">simple term for the constant and then if</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">you start thinking about what&#39;s the term</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">in front of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">x well we can take k0 times a1 and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">k1 times a0</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">those are the two things in the product</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">they&#39;re going to result in x just to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">power of one</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">and you know i think a lot of you kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">of know how to do this we&#39;re just doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">a foil basically between two different</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">polynomials one of them just</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">happens to be infinite and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">next term is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">answer to the live quiz so let me go</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">ahead and pop over there</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">see what most people are saying here so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">it looks like we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">92 93 people answering correctly</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">um that it&#39;s a which basically is just</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">marching through all of the pairs so</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">that the index on the k</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">added together with the index on the a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">is equal to three</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">and uh those of you who answered b it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">like completely in the right thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just that we&#39;re multiplying by a</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">quadratic um polynomial instead of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">multiplying by</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">something that goes on forever as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:43.919" style="s2">so there is no k3 term</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:45.679" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the only distractor in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.919" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">that one question</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">and so you know you know how this goes</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">various different terms that we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">get it&#39;s a nice big product</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">a way that you could think about</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">multiplying two polynomials like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">that&#39;s actually heavy heavily related</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">now to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">all the ideas that we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">about is i&#39;m going to take a copy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">that polynomial</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">and then i&#39;m going to take this</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">quadratic but i want a copy of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">quadratic which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">turned around so i&#39;m putting the k2 term</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">on the left and then the k0 term on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">we could imagine doing exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">little kernel for our image was doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">just having it march across</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">where first here we we align the k zero</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">with the a0 terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">we multiply them and then we have it</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">march one further</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">and we align the k1 with the a0 and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">k0 with the a1</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">multiply the corresponding terms and add</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">them together and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">exactly what we get for our next term</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">here then we have it march along once</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">play the same game multiply</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.080" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">corresponding terms add them all</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">and what you see is that the terms in</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">the new polynomial</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">could be described as a convolution</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">between the terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">in the original polynomials that we had</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">but notice that in order for that to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">work we needed this convention where</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">one of the polynomials was flipped</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">around before you do this marching</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">so because that&#39;s how it comes up in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">lot of mathematical contexts this ends</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">up being a convention</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">more broadly but it does actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">little bit of um</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">influence on on the image processing</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">context because there&#39;s a heavy analogy</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">here between</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">the values k in some little polynomial</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">and the values of our kernel</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">and then thinking of all of these values</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">a as being kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">pixel values right except instead of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">storing them in different spots</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like we&#39;re storing them</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">next to an associated power of x</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">now that might seem like a strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">to do with pixels and indeed we never</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">really do that with pixels</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">but one thing that we actually do do is</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">take a um</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">a slight variation of this where instead</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">of multiplying each pixel value</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">by x we might multiply it by this e to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">the two pi</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">i times some sort of frequency term and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">as we take the power of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">you get this thing that rotates across</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">and it lets you pull out frequency</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">information from the uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">image now i&#39;m not expecting uh people</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">watching this to necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">about fourier transforms or fourier</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">series if you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">you know i hear there&#39;s a youtube</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">channel that covers some of these topics</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">you could watch some of the videos of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">but at a very high level i do want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">try to finish the lecture showing you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">really cool about convolutions and about</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">making them more</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">computationally efficient than you might</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">think is possible and the only things</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">you need to know about</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">fourier transforms is we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">something very analogous to power series</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">and then mathematically it behaves very</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">similarly</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">so all we&#39;re doing is taking these</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">values and multiplying them by something</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">it&#39;s not x but it&#39;s something that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">have successive powers of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">and what that means is that if we do</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">that to two different</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">arrays to two different collections of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">multiplying the two results corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">to convolving the original terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">so for example right when we take the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">polynomial that was generated by k</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">and we multiply it by the polynomial</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">that was generated by these a terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">we get a new polynomial where each term</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:03.760" style="s2">is a convolution between a and k</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">same thing would happen if we replaced x</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.760" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">with something um</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">like this e to the two pi i stuff all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">the terms from one</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">if you take this collection of the terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">from one what&#39;s going to be called the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">fourier transform of that thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">and you multiply it by the fourier</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">transform of the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">it corresponds to convolving the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">original terms now this will be a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">bit easier to see if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">just again actually pull up a notebook</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">and play around with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">so what i&#39;m going to do is let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">remind ourselves what the image looked</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">this was the cat and i&#39;ve just written a</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">very simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">plot 1d fourier spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">oh asking me to update my software in</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">the middle of a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">how rude all right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">uh again i&#39;m not necessarily expecting</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">everyone to know</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">what a fourier transform is but at a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">high level i want to be able to describe</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">what information about the image it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">pulling out so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">tom the cat is a rather soft image with</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">not a lot of variation happening from</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">left to right</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">so if i go through and i try to ask um</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">you know is there very very fine detail</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">high frequency changes happening as we</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">move from left to right</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">there&#39;s not necessarily going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">lot of information there</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">now i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">this is taking as long as it is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">all right maybe it had to pre-compile</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">the function for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">but tom doesn&#39;t actually produce a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">interesting fourier transform and he</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give a good in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">uh instinct for what information is</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">being pulled out so what we could do</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll go ahead and get rid of his uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">convolution term there</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">is take a more interesting image so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">prepared one</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">that&#39;s just a herd of zebra</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">so this heard of zebra we&#39;ve got lots of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">stripes as you move from the left to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">kernel by the way i&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">prepare ourselves a gaussian kernel here</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">let&#39;s get a gaussian that&#39;s maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">know this nine by nine thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">if we look at the uh this fourier</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">information associated with the image</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">the only thing i want you to notice is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">that as you go away from zero</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">you actually have higher values so for</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">example it kind of peaks up</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">a little above 50 here which almost</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">certainly corresponds with the frequency</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">of the stripes themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">as we move from left to right now the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">reason i bring all of this up</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">is to try to highlight what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">we take the convolution of this image</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m going to create a new image</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:32.000" style="s2">called conv-m</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.279" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">that&#39;s going to convolve the image with</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">that kernel</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">which we define to be a gaussian and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">as you expect it&#39;s a blurrier version of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">the of the zebras</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">but now if we do the same thing we plot</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">this 1d fourier spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">but we do it on the convolved version of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">the image what we get looks very similar</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:49.840" style="s2">to the original</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">but notice how what&#39;s happening around</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.840" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">the edges have been pushed down</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s a way of saying all the high</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">frequency stuff happening with the image</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">all that finer detail</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">is no longer there so now it&#39;s behaving</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">a lot more like the image of the cat</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">that was soft all around</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s actually something much more</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">specific that&#39;s happening here where</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">it turns out that the uh the fourier</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">transform of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">gaussian kernel is another gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">curve</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:17.279" style="s2">specifically in such a way that if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">have a really narrow gaussian the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.279" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">fourier transform</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">is something really broad if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">broad one it gives you something really</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">narrow</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">and if we just look at the gauss the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">fourier information just the frequency</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">and we multiply it by a bell curve kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">of squishing down what&#39;s at the outer</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">regions</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">that gets us the same fourier</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">and remember how a little bit earlier i</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">was talking about the computational</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">complexity here how as we have a really</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.640" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">big kernel</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">it requires a lot of multiplications it</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">turns out if instead we</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">first translate things to describing it</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">in terms of the frequencies of the image</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">where convolution is just like</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">multiplication so we can just</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">multiply the two functions as functions</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">just pixel by pixel</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">and then we take it back it gives us a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">much faster way to do this operation</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">and given that this is a course about</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">computational thinking i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">there is a certain general principle to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">be had in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">where finding different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">represent your information actually can</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">sometimes help you do things much faster</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">now here i&#39;m plotting just um a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">one-dimensional thing it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">marching across the image from left to</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">but we could uh show what did i write</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">like heat map 2d fourier spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">again i&#39;ll share this notebook if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">want to play with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">um we can do kind of a two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">analog</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">where the information that comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">this again i think it has to pre-compile</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">is essentially saying what&#39;s the level</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">of detail happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">both in the vertical and horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">direction so in this context</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">you know we get this strange galactic</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">and if we apply it to the smoothed out</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">the convolved image uh not con</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">image conv image what we see is that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">actually pushes down the values</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">that are far away and concentrates us</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">towards the center and just to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">see the contrast if we had started off</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">with a much softer image</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">started off with something like tom</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:12.240" style="s2">he&#39;s soft to begin with this uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">this fourier spectrum which again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">okay if it&#39;s not crystal clear what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">supposed to represent</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">all i want you to know is that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">farther away you are from the center</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">the brightness of those values</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">corresponds to the level of detail</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">that this is what like a softer image</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">looks like and as you multiply by</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">a gaussian in this fourier space it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">pushes you towards this smoother looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">and that&#39;s a much faster operation so</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:37.519" style="s2">often in the standard libraries for</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">convolutions they don&#39;t do the naive</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">thing when you have a large kernel</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">instead they do this more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">and again you can see kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">effect this has had so here the version</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">of the function convolved that i wrote</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not doing the sophisticated thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just doing the naive you have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">little grid of values march across and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">you have them uh multiply and add as you</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">and you&#39;ll be doing that in the problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">set uh this week</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">so uh i think oh man a half hour is such</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">a short time</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">all right i&#39;ve already run out uh but</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">that is the basics of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">image convolutions and the main thing i</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">want you to take away here</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">is a a simple tool that seemed like it</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">was specific at first where we were just</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">doing moving averages</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">if you abstract in the right way right</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">you write it so that rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">hard coding all of the moving average</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">functionality you take it out where</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">this general convolution principle can</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">be applied as its own and we tweak</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">some data we tweak the kernel that lets</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">you do qualitatively different things</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:33.679" style="s2">with your data</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">so in this case it let us do things like</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.679" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">blurring like sharpening like edge</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">detecting</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.800" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">and then the other thing is that when</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:43.359" style="s2">you represent your data in distinct ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">so uh in this context if we were taking</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.359" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">the fourier</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">information taking this frequency</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">information sometimes that actually lets</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">you do things</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">much faster even though you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">under the hood</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">um well not under the hood like in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">abstract sense you&#39;re doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">operations on the data</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.240" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">one domain can often be different from</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.640" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">another and how it behaves</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">so with that i&#39;m going to call it an</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">into this first lecture</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">um for the mit students in the course</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do uh like a zoom call</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the profs um</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.040" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">just discussing more of this material in</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">person so you can interact there</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">as always there&#39;s the discord so please</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">do jump into the discord ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">have discussion</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:30.050" style="s2">and i will see you next week and enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.839" end="00:35:33.689" style="s2">the first problem set</p>
